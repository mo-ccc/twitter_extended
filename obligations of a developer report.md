# Obligations of a developer
#### Mohammed Ahmad

A developer has professional, ethical and legal obligations both in and out of the workplace. This report aims to discuss whether these obligations are warranted and who/what is impacted by them.

## professional obligations
Professional obligations are those obligations associated with being courteous and responsible when carrying out ones duties. This involves the professional properly understanding and communicating the responsibilities of their role as well as well as more nuanced details such as delivering their work on time. There is more to it than just blind compliance however; being a professional also means that one is able to have boundaries of their own which should be respected.

### Timely delivery
Corporate entities function on deadlines and for the entities to be efficient it is extremely important that deadlines are met. As a developer/operations professional there is a degree of leniency that is afforded by employers due to the unpredictable nature of working in an industry with no firm procedures. This leniency however should only be extended in the event where the developer is facing actual difficulty and not complacent because their untimeliness is very likely to upset numerous people.

On the other hand, management has been known to rush developers to meet unrealistic deadlines without understanding the consequences of doing so. Very often, as a result of the rushed circumstances the developer is forced to compromise the quality of their work. However very often is this recognized as a lack of professionalism on managements behalf and the high turnover in the industry is most likely telling of this double standard. In a true professional setting developers should not be forced to compromise on the quality of the system they are working on in exchange for a faster delivery to the market.

In this case I have completed the project on time and met my own expectations as well as the expectations outlined in the work assigned to me. At first the deadline was very short forcing me to rush, however, the deadline was extended and I was able to produce a quality product in the newly assigned time frame.

### Explicitness about ongoing maintenance of systems
With the ever growing needs of consumers there is always a need to update the systems in place whether that means scaling the system to handle larger loads or adopting new technology to provide new services or improve already existing services. Other things like security and resources always need to be maintained and this application is not an exception to either. Developers need to communicate the importance that they play once the product is pushed to the market and the development role they fulfilled is over. This also means that employers need to understand what is being communicated to them and be completely aware of the consequences of an impulsive measure to cut costs such as making the developers redundant once development has ended. 

In this case as the lead and only developer I have a great deal of responsibility to making sure the application is kept secure and is able to keep up with the rapid evolution of the internet.

## Ethical obligations
Ethical obligations are at most times independent of legal obligations. An action may not have any legal implications however if it is going to effect someone/something negatively then it is of ethical concern. Two notorious ethical concerns are the collection of data by organizations and working for corporations that have a negative impact on society.

### Collection of data
Collecting information on users is a very common practice in the industry and organizations are able to make detailed profiles on their users without running into any legal trouble. This is an ethically questionable practice as if the organization does not properly secure the information of their users, the information can be used by hackers to harm them. Developers are unlikely to have a say in what data the organization collects on users, however very often the developer is responsible for making sure that the data does not fall into the wrong hands. Therefore it is the developers ethical responsibility to ensure they have done their due diligence in properly securing the systems and minimizing the amount of damage that would be caused in the event of a security breach.

The twitter application does not collect more data than what is necessary and users are able to hide behind a wall of anonymity for better or worse. On top of this the only sensitive data that is used on the platform, the password, is stored as a hash using bcrypt which means that in the event of a security breach attackers will not have much to gain. On the other hand as twitter_extended does not have cross-site request foregery(csrf) tokens attackers can use csrf to target users and make their devices perform unwanted actions.

### Choosing what to work on/for
The developer has the final say in what they choose to work on/for. This means that the ethical responsibility of aiding organizations that are malicious in nature like terror groups falls on the developer. Unfortunately organizations that don't practice good ethics are able to adopt public services and weaponise them. 

Twitter_extended with its complete anonymity is a good target for people with faulty moral compasses. On the other hand applications like twitter_extended can also do a great deal of good by connecting people. Considering that perspectve twitter_extended was not created with purpose to aid any malicious entities and was created as a means to demonstrate a concept. Ultimately the developer is best suited to make the final decision on which organizations they provide their services to and the developer at the very least should be able to live with the direct consequences of the work they end up doing. 

## Legal obligations
Legal obligations are the obligations that are directly tied in with the law. Unlawful actions that a developer takes are directly punishable by the government they are liable for. This includes bringing harm to the public or

### Public safety
Developers have a lot of power over others and this trend is only becoming more potent. Developers can use their positions to commit acts of terrorism such as adding malware to self driving cars that cause traffic collisions. When developers add in this malicious code they are legally prosecutable and can be charged with felonies. Additionally developers can be held responsible for tragedies when they had no evil intent simply because they were a scape goat for when things went wrong.

As mentioned previously the anonymity that users can register with can be used to carry out legal misconduct. While this is not a direct consequence of the codebase there is a requirement for services to excercise due diligence in removing and mitigating offensive material/offenders. Unlike the real twitter however, twitter_extended lacks the resources needed to monitor the platform 24/7. On the other hand, unlike twitter, because twitter_extended is extremely small scale and is not a complete product it is easy enough for it to be taken down completely.

## Copyright
Twitter is protected by copyright/trademark laws in many countries. Because of this twitter owns all the things that makes their brand distincitve including logos and the name. Using the name twitter_extended could pose an issue, however, because the name is used in a transformative nature and is open source and does not turn a profit then it is very likely that it is protected by fair use laws. Furthermore, aside from the name twitter extended only borrows one more asset from twitter being the default profile icon. This may not be treated as fair use however it is easily exchangeable and is used in an educative nature.

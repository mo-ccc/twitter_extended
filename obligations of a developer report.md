# Obligations of a developer

A developer has professional, ethical and legal obligations both in and out of the workplace. This report aims to discuss whether these obligations are warranted and who/what is impacted by them.

## professional obligations
Professional obligations are those obligations associated with being courteous and responsible when carrying out ones duties. This involves the professional properly understanding and communicating the responsibilities of their role as well as well as more nuanced details such as delivering their work on time. There is more to it than just blind compliance however; being a professional also means that one is able to have boundaries of their own which should be respected.

### Timely delivery
Corporate entities function on deadlines and for the entities to be efficient it is extremely important that deadlines are met. As a developer/operations professional there is a degree of leniency that is afforded by employers due to the unpredictable nature of working in an industry with no firm procedures. This leniency however should only be extended in the event where the developer is facing actual difficulty and not complacent because their untimeliness is very likely to upset numerous people.

On the other hand, management has been known to rush developers to meet unrealistic deadlines without understanding the consequences of doing so. Very often, as a result of the rushed circumstances the developer is forced to compromise the quality of their work. However very often is this recognized as a lack of professionalism on managements behalf and the high turnover in the industry is most likely telling of this double standard. In a true professional setting developers should not be forced to compromise on the quality of the system they are working on in exchange for a faster delivery to the market.

### Explicitness about ongoing maintenance of systems
With the ever growing needs of consumers there is always a need to update the systems in place whether that means scaling the system to handle larger loads or adopting new technology to provide new services or improve already existing services. Other things like security and resources always need to be maintained. Ultimately developers need to communicate the importance that they play once the product is pushed to the market and the development role they fulfilled is over.

This also means that employers need to understand what is being communicated to them and be completely aware of the consequences of an impulsive measure to cut costs such as making the developers redundant once development has ended.

## Ethical obligations
Ethical obligations are at most times independent of legal obligations. An action may not have any legal implications however if it is going to effect someone/something negatively then it is of ethical concern. Two notorious ethical concerns are the collection of data by organizations and working for corporations that have a negative impact on society.

### Collection of data
Collecting information on users is a very common practice in the industry and organizations are able to make detailed profiles on their users without running into any legal trouble. This is an ethically questionable practice as if the organization does not properly secure the information of their users, the information can be used by hackers to harm them. Developers are unlikely to have a say in what data the organization collects on users, however very often the developer is responsible for making sure that the data does not fall into the wrong hands. Therefore it is the developers ethical responsibility to ensure they have done their due diligence in properly securing the systems and minimizing the amount of damage that would be caused in the event of a security breach.

### Choosing who to work for
The developer has the final say in who they choose to work for. This means that the ethical responsibility of aiding companies that are malicious in nature falls on the developer. Unfortunately companies that don't practice good ethics also have monetary incentives that may make it difficult for a developer to turn them down. On the other hand developers can also work for organizations that do a great deal of good and are more often than not their choice goes unrecognized. Ultimately the developer is best suited to make the final decision on which organizations they provide their services to and the developer at the very least should be able to live with the direct consequences of the work they end up doing. 

## Legal obligations
Legal obligations are the obligations that are directly tied in with the law. Unlawful actions that a developer takes are directly punishable by the government they are liable for. This includes bringing harm to the public or breaking the terms of agreement they sign when they begin working for an employer.

### Software Development Agreement
The software development agreement is an agreement signed by employer and employee to protect  intellectual property. More often than not however the employer manages to sneak a few conditions in that are disadvantageous to the developer such as a non compete clause which persists even after the employee contract is terminated. Other parts of the agreement 
require confidentiality from the developer while prohibiting the developer of any ownership of the product they are working on. While these are all very legal practices that do protect the intellectual property of the company, they are also hazardous to the well being of the developer. 

### Public safety
Developers have a lot of power over others and this trend is only becoming more potent. Developers can use their positions to commit acts of terrorism such as adding malware to self driving cars that cause traffic collisions. When developers add in this malicious code they are legally prosecutable and can be charged with felonies. Additionally developers can be held responsible for tragedies when they had no evil intent simply because they are a scape goat for when things go wrong.
